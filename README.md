Using Dynamic and ENS, you are able to link your favorite social accounts and NFTs.

Allowing a smooth entry and verification both online and IRL.

The NFC wristband acts as a burner signer, allowing you to prove your identity or membership throught NFT ownership proofs without ever compromising both your security or privacy.

Discord servers can automatically detect your membership, private IRL side-events/party too.
